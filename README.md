# DETECTION AND ASSESSMENT OF WIRELESS NETWORK ATTACKS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

This repository contains the code and resources for the thesis project:  
**"DETECTION AND ASSESSMENT OF WIRELESS NETWORK ATTACKS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES"**

The project focuses on detecting wireless network intrusions using machine learning models. It combines supervised learning and unsupervised anomaly detection to identify both known and zero-day attacks effectively.

---

## Core Objectives

- Preprocess wireless traffic data
- Apply feature selection techniques
- Train various ML models 
- Use Autoencoders for Zero-Day attack detection
- Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1 score, ROC, confusion matrix, etc.
